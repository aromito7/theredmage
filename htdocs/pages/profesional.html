<h1>Experience</h1>
<p style="font-size:32px;">At the end of my sophomore year of college I transfered from Electical Engineering to Mathetmatics and graduated with a degree from the Melon College of Science.  I also completed 27 (out of 36 needed) towards a master's degree in Applied Mathematics when I left to work at Summa Technologies as a programmer.
