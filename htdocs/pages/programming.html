		<p>I took an intro to programming class my junior year of highschool in java.  After finishing my work early one day, I found some tutorials online about how to do graphics in java.  The first program I ever wrote for myself rather than for class was a drawing of the Halo 2 logo, and the feeling of satisfaction I got from it was incredible.
